# Weather-App
Personal small project :)

It displays the weather data based on your location and the location you input.
The background image and colour changes as the weather changes, and the dark mode is activated by the current time and by toggling a button.
Separate background images are used for night times and day times.

It is mobile friendly.

API retrived from Weatherbit.io. 
The API key is on a free plan so if the weather data is not showing then the daily request limit is exceeded.
